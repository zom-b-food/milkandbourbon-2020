													<h4>Excerpt from <em>"Walking Through Brambles: a
															narrative of
															circumspection"</em></h4>



													<p>Rain comes to Valencia like typhus: wind, thunder,
														rain—predictable and
														ruthless. And once it passes, recovery is slow and
														the entire valley,
														exhausted. Valencia, however, never floods—nothing
														drowns, nothing is
														fully immersed. The earth is marked just a little,
														scratched just a
														bit immediately after the fall. And from the
														runoff, the bleeding, the
														landscape is re-tissued as though a top layer of
														skin has
														molted—nature's facelift. Our little Garden of
														Eden once again is as
														it was in the beginning before the fall, before
														Gethsemane, before the
														atonement when rain was nothing more than
														absorbed, when rain did
														nothing more than fall.</p>

													<p>Delicate flora has washed away. Colors not diluted
														by the master artist
														now appear freshly painted, glossy in the
														aftermath. Ferns are now a
														deeper green, their jagged edges sharper than
														ever. Nature's confetti
														lays everywhere. Fallout consisting of anonymous
														blossoms, buds and
														leaves still hold their colors but have somehow
														lost their virtue in
														the storm. Pathways, fountains, and ponds display
														a similar
														complexion, distinction muted by the downpour.
														Nature celebrated a new
														year it seems, or maybe a wedding—a consummation
														by the look of
														things. The afterthoughts can be uncomfortably
														familiar, or
														unfamiliar. Is it worth the mess, one wonders?</p>

													<p>Yellow Cat weathered the storm, perched on the piano
														bench. The sound of
														my playing, comparable to thunder, must transfix
														her, purring as
														usual, paws and chin resting upon my lap.
														Unfortunately, I practice
														only as often as it rains here. The piano, more
														than anything, serves
														merely as a reminder of music. Where the mission
														choir is an ensemble
														of cathedral acoustics, gothic accompaniment and
														the interplay of
														audience and angels; my piano, on the other hand,
														is the solo. It is
														only me. It is more sound than music, more cliché
														than opus, more
														heart than voice. But Yellow Cat lays still and
														listens; and maybe in
														the studio upstairs, my music is heard as well.
													</p>

													<p>Although the rain dilutes the valley's colors, it
														enriches the
														atmosphere with earthy aromas as hearty as smoke.
														After the
														cloudburst, the fertile air draws all life into
														the open. Noses
														swelling, windward, townsfolk ponder the
														familiarity in the air that
														only comes after rain. The green cologne of the
														river, woods, and sea
														plus everything sweet that perished in the storm
														attack the senses
														like a crusade of meadows. Topsoil smells up the
														air with that rich,
														gritty decay of earth. The breeze brings a
														spring-cleaned energy
														comparable to that of April's last layer of snow
														sinking into the
														piney soil, cleaning the earth's pores before
														trickling into pools and
														streams across the valley.</p>

													<h4>Identification and Storytelling:</h4>
													<h5><em>The Appeal of Franklin Burroughs&rsquo;
															Narrative Essays</em></h5>

													<p>In his collection of personal essays entitled,
														<em>Billy Watson&rsquo;s
															Croker Sack</em>, Franklin Burroughs utilizes
														the genre&rsquo;s
														most prevalent rhetorical strategy of
														identification through story
														telling. Unlike the formal essay that may appeal
														to an
														audience&rsquo;s
														specific interests and curiosities,
														Burroughs&rsquo; personal essays
														often appeal to a general audience&rsquo;s
														ambivalence between right
														and wrong and the environment in which their daily
														routines are
														perceived, rationalized and accepted. He envelopes
														his readers in a
														milieu of personal secrets, selective histories
														and keen perceptions
														of everyday life. Through his candid literary
														demeanor and his
														intimate conversational rhetoric, he positions
														himself as the
														<em>everyman</em>.
														Burroughs does not assert or praise his
														credibility; but instead, he
														reminds his readers of their universal kinship and
														the experiences
														com&shy;mon to everyone. He attempts to
														communicate a reasoning that
														will casually blend the entire human race into one
														heterogenous
														family. Mainly through stories and anecdotes--the
														genre&rsquo;s
														primary rhetorical devise--Burroughs identifies
														with a general mass
														audience through a reverent conversation of
														life&rsquo;s minor
														generalities and a candid disclosure of his own
														failures and
														emotional fragility.</p>

													<p>According to Holman and Harmon&rsquo;s <em>A
															Handbook to
															Literature</em>, the personal or informal
														essay is characterized
														by &ldquo;the personal element (self-revelation,
														individual tastes
														and experiences, confidential
														manner)...unconventionality or novelty
														of theme...and freedom from stiffness and
														affectation&rdquo; (Holman
														193). In his forward to <em>The Art of the
															Personal Essay</em>,
														Philip Lopate writes that &ldquo;the
														conversational dynamic--the
														desire for contact--is ingrained in the form, and
														serves to
														establish a quick emotional intimacy with the
														audience&rdquo;
														(Lopate 2). These observations are evidenced
														throughout
														Burroughs&rsquo;
														collection as he discusses life&rsquo;s
														personality from the
														perspective of the provincial New Englander. His
														collec&shy;tion
														consists of five essays all evaluating and
														reacting to the
														complexities of life and death in modern but rural
														America. He
														describes a local dimension of life that is free
														of the world&rsquo;s
														abrasive competitiveness, and he involves his
														readers in
														<em>his</em> world--a separate reality where he
														can confess his own
														fears and inadequacies.</p>

													<p>Recollections of boyhood and descriptions of the
														land&shy;scape are
														inherent in Burroughs&rsquo; essays. The innocence
														of childhood and
														nature &ldquo;undefiled&rdquo; is discussed in a
														homey,
														unpretentious rhetoric that appeals to the simple,
														unrefined,
														child-like qualities of his audience. He
														elaborates on the
														hillside&rsquo;s
														weeds and grasses and in a neighborly editorial on
														the weather, he
														discusses nature&rsquo;s routines and his own
														droll attitudes of
														home. &ldquo;Crackers limp as old lettuce,&rdquo;
														an expres&shy;sion
														bordering clich&eacute; is placidly expressed by a
														narrative voice
														which at times can be equally clich&eacute; or
														banal--simple,
														unashamed but heroically sincere (Burroughs 5). It
														is easy for one
														to imagine the author as a quiet, non-threatening
														figure draped in
														loose fitting overalls, standing upon the seat of
														his tractor,
														gazing at the valley before him as he describes
														&ldquo;our
														fields,&rdquo;
														in the following detail:</p>

													<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The stitchwort, vetch,
														buttercup,
														bedstraw and blue-eyed grass...thriving amid the
														adversities of soil
														and climate, their inconspicuous beauty seems
														reflective of rural
														New England, and it is pleasing to learn that
														people here once found
														more than aesthetic solace in them (Burroughs 9).
													</p>

													<p>He further appeals to his and his audience&rsquo;s
														commonness in
														describing his &ldquo;Southern boyhood&rdquo; that
														was filled
														with &ldquo;that strange Wordsworthian hunger for
														landscape&rdquo;
														(Burroughs 10). Certainly by the end of the tenth
														page, readers can
														identify with Burroughs&rsquo; natural,
														uncomplicated
														self-portrait.</p>

													<p>Throughout most of his book, Burroughs presents
														himself (as Edmund
														Waller may have noted 350 years ago) as the
														self-sequestered man. He
														is alone and removed from the rest of the world
														where he can observe
														man and nature unnoticed. And it is during this
														seclusion when
														Burroughs receives these random and quixotic
														perceptions and
														insights into everyday life. Lopate again in his
														forward to <em>The
															Art of the Personal Essay</em> informs us of
														the essayist as one
														who &ldquo;claims unique access to the small,
														humble things in
														life&rdquo;
														(Lopate 5). Bur&shy;roughs certainly attempts to
														portray this
														affection early in his collection and it is
														evidenced throughout the
														entire book. Lopate also notes that &ldquo;this
														taste for the
														miniature becomes a strong suit of the form: the
														ability to turn
														anything close at hand...into a grand meditation
														adventure&rdquo;
														(Lopate 9).</p>

													<p>Burroughs is very much attuned to the quiet, ambient
														side of life,
														and although he doesn&rsquo;t embellish as much as
														other narrative
														writers may, he more closely scrutinizes the
														minia&shy;ture and
														discusses what most of us would consider
														unneces&shy;sary. This is
														particularly clear as he describes his activities
														on the opening day
														of duck hunting season.&nbsp;</p>

													<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The day faded on into
														ordinariness; it
														would regain a little of its special quality only
														after supper, when
														I would go out into the barn, pluck the teal and
														dress them, watched
														by Mink and Mrs. Pino, our two semi-domestic cats.
														Then would clean
														the gun, swabbing out the barrels until they shone
														like mirrors when
														I held them to the light and looked through them.
														Would carefully
														save a few of the flank feathers and a wing for
														trout flies; would
														reward the cats with a visceral morsel; would wrap
														and label the
														ducks and put them in the freezer. That would be
														it, an annual
														observance completed (Burroughs 103).</p>

													<p>By omitting the subject of the final four phrases,
														Burroughs omits
														<em>himself</em> to suggest that even
														<strong><em>he</em></strong>
														is perhaps too obvious to mention and too ordinary
														to even care.
														This is a clear rhetori&shy;cal strategy that
														reiterates the
														event&rsquo;s
														repetitive calculation. It also appears from this
														final sentence
														that even the author, caught up in the rush of
														tradition and local
														patriotism, honors an observance of which he is
														morally uncertain.
														He therefore confronts, with some reservation, the
														moral challenges
														and social obligations that most people will at
														some time
														encoun&shy;ter.
														But his stories, more than anything, present the
														author as a
														regular-kind-of-guy. He is simple, honest and
														kind. The natural
														intimacy of his narrative is powerfully inviting
														to the individual
														who also perceives himself as a
														regular-kind-of-guy.</p>

													<p>Burroughs is fascinated with milieu and the pace at
														which he moves
														his thoughts within it. His rambling stream of
														consciousness is not
														specifically a rhetorical treatment but is
														certainly a rhetorical
														style that allows him to ponder his own
														perceptions and color them
														according to his current mood or voice. Each essay
														within the
														collection relates significantly to this milieu
														and to the
														author&rsquo;s
														place within the natural world. This is
														particularly evident in the
														following passage from Burroughs&rsquo; third
														essay.</p>

													<p style="padding-left: 60px;">It always seemed to be
														somewhere in the
														middle of a summer afternoon. Floors being cooler
														than rugs or beds.
														I would lie on the floor in front of an
														oscillating fan, its breeze
														passing over me, going away, hesitating at the end
														of its arc,
														returning (Burroughs 47).&nbsp;</p>

													<p>Again, Burroughs&rsquo; story appeals to our sense
														of calm-ness--a
														stagnation in time where he pauses to study the
														rhythm of an arcing
														fan to a degree that permits him to reflect on the
														transience and
														immediate purpose of his own life. His description
														of the plain
														implies that the author is never beyond the common
														and ordinary,
														that he is merely a random creation of nature and
														a victim of its
														indifference. But his narrative also suggests a
														balance and
														proportion for a life that is consumed with
														business and worldly
														responsibilities. Consider how his audience might
														relate or identify
														with the following passage.</p>

													<p style="padding-left: 60px;">So I would relapse into
														the Upper
														Peninsula, making it my refuge for another empty
														summer afternoon,
														while the fan hummed and the cicadas outside
														buzzed their parched,
														whetstone song, lapping and overlap&shy;ping
														itself in slow waves,
														until at last dusk fell, a faint coolness seeped
														out from the grass,
														and the toads and crickets took over (Burroughs
														48).</p>

													<p>Even if his reader never makes it to the mountains
														in Wyo&shy;ming or
														the backwoods of Kentucky, he has no trouble
														envisioning the comfort
														and peace of the places Burroughs describes.&nbsp;
													</p>

													<p>Aside from these hum-drum normalities of life,
														Burroughs admits his
														failures and accepts his inadequacies as another
														facet of life and
														another dimension of nature. His life and
														reputation is circumspect.
														He is bound to provincial exclu&shy;sion. His
														rhetoric is plaintive
														and describes a man bullied by ambition and made
														common by
														circumstance and history. This attitude develops
														as his past is
														remembered while fishing one morning in a small
														New England
														pond.</p>

													<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I was bookish and
														introverted as a boy,
														lived more in theory than among facts, and always
														waited on a time
														when my circumstances would at last conform to
														what was prescribed
														by authors, and deliver me from an identity which,
														whether measured
														against my own standards, or against the modest
														and sensible
														expecta&shy;tions
														of my parents, was ignominious. I read all about
														fishing:...the
														throwline, the cork, and a cricket or caterpillar
														on the hook came
														to seem too much like what I feared my life would
														be--something
														local, undistinguished, and limited, beneath the
														notice of
														literature and without shape or certification
														(Burroughs 54-55).</p>

													<p>While we are meant to understand Burroughs&rsquo;
														disillusion&shy;ment
														with life, we are also intended to relate to his
														queerish boyhood in
														order to find a perspective for
														<strong><em>our</em></strong>
														queerish natures. Lopate explains it this way.
														&ldquo;The trick is
														to realize that one is not important, except
														insofar as one&rsquo;s
														example can serve to elucidate a more widespread
														human trait and
														make readers feel a little less lonely and
														freakish&rdquo; (Lopate
														6).&nbsp;</p>

													<p>Further insight into Burroughs&rsquo; audience can
														be seen in how the
														author represents himself and in his subtextual
														description of the
														reader with whom he attempts to identify. In the
														previous citation,
														Burroughs confesses a fear in becom&shy;ing or
														remaining &ldquo;local,
														undistinguished and limited.&rdquo; But a more
														attentive reading
														suggests that Burroughs, in his effort to
														identify, may actually
														alienate or distance himself from his general
														audience by suggesting
														that they too are &ldquo;local, undistinguished
														and limited.&rdquo;
														If we initially accept Burroughs&rsquo; appeal to
														an unsophisticated
														and general mass audience, we must also accept his
														reader&rsquo;s
														general and unsophisticated identitiy within his
														respective
														community. Consider for a moment how the local
														school principal may
														perceive himself within his own community and also
														consider how the
														<em>local</em> minister, sales clerk or secretary
														may identify with
														Burroughs&rsquo; &ldquo;uncertified&rdquo;
														classification. Is it
														unfair for us to assume that his readers have
														similar perspectives
														of their own provincial limitations and
														inadequacies that Burroughs
														infers?</p>

													<p>Perhaps the most accurate analysis of
														Burroughs&rsquo; audience lies
														in the nature of his confessions itself. Perhaps
														these personal
														confessions are intended not exclusively for a
														general readership
														but for Burroughs himself. For most personal
														essayists, writing is
														therapy--purging, through confession and
														self-confrontation, the
														loneliness and despair that they often see in
														themselves. In this
														respect, it is reason&shy;able to believe that
														Burroughs is still
														reaching within himself for a deeper understanding
														of the local and
														undistinguished persona that his essays display.
														It is equally
														reasonable to suspect that, <em>Billy
															Watson&rsquo;s Croker
															Sack</em> is a testament of the
														author&rsquo;s attempt to
														identify with <em>himself</em> and not solely with
														an
														unsophisticated, unassuming and undistinguished
														regional audience.
														Burroughs himself may indeed be the
														collection&rsquo;s primary
														audience.</p>

													<p>Burroughs&rsquo; rhetoric is free of fancy terms,
														specialized jargon
														and gothic analogies and metaphors. Rather his
														anecdotes and stories
														become his predominant rhetorical pulse. Within
														these stories he
														appeals to his audience&rsquo;s romantic moods and
														is able to use
														their sensitivities to justify their telling. In
														some instances, his
														milieu of melancholy and nostalgia is so morose
														that one reads his
														confessions with a measure of pity and
														responsibility for the
														author&rsquo;s
														bad luck and failure to succeed. Perhaps Burroughs
														is only
														interested in communicating what Gore Vidal has
														said about narrative
														literature. &ldquo;The true confessors have been
														aware that not only
														is life mostly failure, but that in one&rsquo;s
														failure or pettiness
														or wrongness exists the living drama of the
														self&rdquo; (Lopate
														9).</p>

													<p>At times, Burroughs&rsquo; dependence upon his
														readers&rsquo;
														sympathy is excessive. After all, as Donald
														Harwood puts it, &ldquo;we
														all have our little sorrows&rdquo; and certainly
														Burroughs, like the
														rest of us, must deal with his personal traumas
														alone (Harwood 33).
														But as Lopate further explains, the personal
														essayist &ldquo;is not
														necessarily out to win the audience&rsquo;s
														unquali&shy;fied love
														but to present the complportrait of a human
														being&rdquo; (Lopate
														8). And so Burroughs&rsquo; stories reflect the
														complexity of the
														<em>human</em> character, and the rhetorical
														treat&shy;ment he uses
														to identify with his audience, mainly gentle
														first-person story
														telling, reflects the complexities of the
														<em>poetical</em>
														character--something that even the most common
														among us hopes to
														possess.</p>

													<p>Burroughs&rsquo; text is rich with simple and plain
														observations made
														extraordinary only by the care of their telling.
														The author elevates
														his subject through his personal rhetoric and his
														intuitive vision
														of the common man. And the common man who becomes
														acquainted with
														<em>Billy Watson&rsquo;s Croker Sack
														</em>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
														escape in a rhetoric of elevated propor&shy;tions
														but is shown how
														his ordinariness is made grand in the perspective
														that Burroughs
														gives it. Irish essayist Hubert Butler explains it
														this way: &ldquo;I
														am more inclined to apologize for writing about
														great events, which
														touched me not at all, than for tracing again the
														tiny snail track
														which I made myself&rdquo; (Lopate 10). Great or
														insignificant
														events in them&shy;selves cannot dictate the types
														of rhetorical
														treatments that a writer may employ in achieving
														his or her
														purposes. But in the genre of the personal
														narrative, the primary
														rhetorical emphasis is placed on the
														writer&rsquo;s ability to
														identify with his audience. And according to
														Burroughs&rsquo; style
														and subject matter, one cannot overlook his
														perspective of the
														little, ubiquitous happenings that many of us no
														longer notice. For
														this reason, Burroughs identifies easily with his
														readers, and his
														story-telling style assures him of a certain
														reader loyalty and
														trust that other writers may not enjoy.</p>

													<h4>A Meditation</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														The bay breezes through my room, <br />
														and a pen rolls across the bureau <br />
														so, so slowly <br />
														while a note glides lightly, gently <br />
														to the foot of my bed. <br />
														Green springs trickle through the bamboo <br />
														knocking against the porch <br />
														as though it were wrapped <br />
														in a pillow. <br />
														<br />
														The bright night illuminates; <br />
														and just beyond the tide&rsquo;s reaching touch
														<br />
														the dunes bow softly into the hillside. <br />
														jasmine and willow sway above the pond <br />
														where a turtle&mdash; <br />
														high priest of this garden, <br />
														rests like me on a ripple <br />
														of circumspection: <br />
														a meditation, a prayer <br />
														a thought not born into speech. <br />
														<br />
														A toad bellows low in the reed beds, <br />
														fireflies linger in the air; <br />
														and a dandelion ascends <br />
														as some do in September <br />
														rising into the dark light. <br />
														The fat yellow moon pulls his eyelids down, <br />
														the warm silver ghost cups me in her hands, <br />
														bliss dripping like dew from her fingers <br />
														and I succumb to her relentless serenity&mdash;
														<br />
														the unsparing comfort of sedation. <br />
														<br />
														Like footsteps on the bare floor, <br />
														the clock taps out a beat&mdash; <br />
														the pulse of nature, <br />
														of some divinity <br />
														nesting somewhere near; <br />
														a mass for the living <br />
														blessed in its subjectivity, <br />
														mercy and compassion. <br />
														<br />
														And almost like a memory <br />
														from a terrace down the hill, <br />
														a spanish guitar floats its voices here <br />
														unplugged from the dissonance of age <br />
														coming humbly, joyfully home&mdash; <br />
														<em>all of life's perfections</em> <br />
														<em>distilled to its finest hour</em> <br />
														<em>is now</em>. <br />
														<br />
														The wind loosens the drapes <br />
														unfolding like wings in the doorway <br />
														as the restful turtle hums <br />
														and a leaf drifts by <br />
														so, so slowly... <br />

														<br />
														of birdsong
														<br />
														whistling between the leaves of the
														<br />
														summer storm
														<br />
														with daisies
														<br />
														and aging blossoms of apples
														<br />
														and buttercups
														<br />
														&nbsp;<br />
														I came to my home against
														<br />
														the Hills
														<br />
														where sun lit waterfalls filled
														<br />
														the streams below;
														<br />
														I heard still
														<br />
														as a little boy in his father's hat
														<br />
														and I climbed again
														<br />
														the Hills
														<br />
														and strode the neighbor's ground
														<br />
														with a lonely pride that only
														<br />
														children know.
														<br />
														&nbsp;<br />
														The summer sounds were brimming
														<br />
														with Color:
														<br />
														the purpling blooms were
														<br />
														waving to the sea,
														<br />
														and cartooned pastels
														<br />
														robed the grasses
														<br />
														bending in the tide of twilight,
														<br />
														and I rose once more to
														<br />
														the whispering words
														<br />
														of Birdsong:
														<br />
														a watery font
														<br />
														with the summer scent
														<br />
														of Home.

													<h4>Communion</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														Waiting for the late sounds
														<br />
														to blow the leaves and
														<br />
														porch bells slow
														<br />
														I listen to the play of
														<br />
														a far away hound
														<br />
														and my feet crunching stones
														<br />
														as I move;
														<br />
														Yet then will I sit
														<br />
														and feel the evening speak
														<br />
														what the angels sing to God.
													</p>
													<hr class="quotes" />

													<h4>The Warm Brook</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														Often the drip
														<br />
														falls with the canon--
														<br />
														Largo for the evening
														<br />
														plays the melody away
														<br />
														to the new-made night;
														<br />
														and the sticks that bow
														<br />
														from the hard trunk
														<br />
														make me dance and drift
														<br />
														on the warm brook,
														<br />
														hoping you'll find me
														<br />
														as your voice
														<br />
														and your wish
														<br />
														wakes the music in
														<br />
														my soul
														<br />
														to never sink alone,
														<br />
														and I can dance
														<br />
														to the canon's pace
														<br />
														like falling sticks on
														<br />
														a sterile stream.
													</p>
													<hr class="quotes" />
													<br />
													<h4>Low Tide</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														The early morning waves
														<br />
														lit by the moon a blue-grey hue
														<br />
														glows the gentle sea
														<br />
														as it rolls upon the sand
														<br />
														I stand on.
														<br />
														The air that sounds small
														<br />
														upon the waving grass
														<br />
														moves through my clothes,
														<br />
														and on my face it stills
														<br />
														till my breath returns again
														<br />
														to the sea
														<br />
														the blowing scent of wasted youth
														<br />
														to dive at the foam in the waves
														<br />
														that pound the quiet eve's crabs
														<br />
														as they soak in the wash and loam,
														<br />
														and I breathe in the night moon
														<br />
														that lights me with its white;
														<br />
														too soft to touch
														<br />
														and too brief to kiss
														<br />
														it sends the wind through my hair
														<br />
														like the fingers of a patient girl
														<br />
														and whisps to me the scent of salt and musk
														<br />
														to savor the sand I still on
														<br />
														as the waterwind
														<br />
														and the sweet shoregrass
														<br />
														walks my wish to the deep again.

													<h4>Summer Bragging</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														Popping beached jellyfish
														<br />
														was the favorite summertime game
														<br />
														longer sticks served best
														<br />
														and quicker strides before and the sting
														<br />
														were useful in bragging,
														<br />
														too eager to work or worry
														<br />
														we rode the waves
														<br />
														till our bellies scraped the sand,
														<br />
														and we raced the crabs
														<br />
														back into the sea,
														<br />
														saltwater always filled my mouth
														<br />
														and I'd quit playing
														<br />
														for a while
														<br />
														until another jellyfish
														<br />
														beached himself beside me.
													</p>
													<hr class="quotes" />
													<br />
													<h4>October Dews</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														Its texture is compelling
														<br />
														like gathered frost along
														<br />
														the brush bottoms at dawn,
														<br />
														it makes me cool
														<br />
														and I breathe like a dragon
														<br />
														coal-sweat spray,
														<br />
														I wake with its alarm so early
														<br />
														and touch the tent top
														<br />
														that its beads may run
														<br />
														down my finger
														<br />
														wanting me to drink,
														<br />
														everything looks new and growing
														<br />
														in the haze and mist
														<br />
														as I walk upon green needles
														<br />
														and mossy smells
														<br />
														tickle
														<br />
														and compel with its feeling
														<br />
														my hands and mouth to touch.
													</p>
													<hr class="quotes" />
													<br />
													<h4>First Light</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														And then the pond will warm
														<br />
														and morning's dust will float
														<br />
														beneath the still cold mist
														<br />
														and the smells like summer's dawn
														<br />
														will raise its breath to the
														<br />
														trees that shade you from
														<br />
														the sky
														<br />
														to sleep or run
														<br />
														until you wake or rest
														<br />
														and summer's first light
														<br />
														is gone to older kin;
														<br />
														and then the pool will boil
														<br />
														and nature's love for nature
														<br />
														will feed herself on her
														<br />
														as the grasses dry in
														<br />
														summer's dusk;
														<br />
														and the now noon steam
														<br />
														will make clouds high
														<br />
														to fly with the birds and dust
														<br />
														for a new place to wake
														<br />
														and another you
														<br />
														to shade.
													</p>
													<hr class="quotes" />

													<h4>Manipulation</h4>

													<p class="poetry">
														Strong music plays little for me
														<br />
														in my snoring chair
														<br />
														thick will pillow
														<br />
														heavy with boring stuff:
														<br />
														sentimental fool
														<br />
														writing of treason that stains the soul
														<br />
														and warns the wet heart
														<br />
														I stick with my pen;
														<br />
														watery songs encourage the discontent
														<br />
														to cheer at the sky
														<br />
														like a freshly spoiled bride,
														<br />
														"Long live the king!
														<br />
														Kill the umpire!
														<br />
														Hail Mary full of it!"
														<br />
														Offend to be offended
														<br />
														slap the child's hand
														<br />
														and wash his dirty tongue;
														<br />
														and I'll burn the bones in the bedroom
														<br />
														while the nigger next door
														<br />
														trims his desperate snuff
														<br />
														and my memory sings from the alley,
														<br />
														"Don't spill the blood of Gethsemane,
														<br />
														the carpet's still too white."
														<br /></p>
