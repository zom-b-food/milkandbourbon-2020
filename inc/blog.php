					<h4>Quantum Bubbles Rising</h4>

					<p>My next book describes consciousness as the matter within a bubble and follows this
						consciousness as it rises from the bottom of the sea
						to it's release into the atmosphere. I think of the bubble as a womb, like the earth
						as a womb for all of us. The bubble holds us, nurtures and teaches us, carries us
						into maturity until we rise to the top and are born into the universe.

					<p>I am the cold grey of a turning sea
						<br />the stillness of a warm bay--
						<br />a balmy sedation
						<br />subtle as glass.

					</p>
					<p>I am the room between thoughts
						<br />the distance between words
						<br />the infinite rests of an unfinished song
						<br />the echo of a mayfly's whisper.

					</p>
					<p>I am the first breath of sleep
						<br />the next tick of an unwound clock
						<br />the last seductive secret;
						<br />I am the ubiquitous space between.
