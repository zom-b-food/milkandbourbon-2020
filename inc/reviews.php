								<span class="white-text">It's the journey, not the destination.</span>
								<p>The author's writing style is intimate and more poetry than prose to me. I
									found particularly delightful his perceptive descriptions of the
									character's relationship with his environment, and his willingness to be in
									the moment.</p>

								<span class="white-text">A relaxing and humorous read.</span>
								<p>Walking Through Brambles by G. W. Latimer was a relaxing escape, and so much
									funnier than I expected. From his observations about yellow cat and
									fatherhood to his day to day life at the library, his observations and dry
									sense of humor had me laughing several times. I can see how many might miss
									the humor, but it's there and so rewarding. This book reads more like a
									diary or journal than a novel, but I took to reading it at night before
									bed. The authors' voice is calming--a perfect end to a busy day in this
									noisy and often stressful world. </p>

								<p>This is definitely a different style and not for everyone- it's more like
									reading a beautiful journal someone has left behind. The descriptions are
									beautiful and exquisite. It's a place I'd want to visit and a life I'd
									enjoy living!
									I liked this book & I would read more from the writer in the future.</p>

								<span class="white-text">A delicious read!</span>
								<p>This narrative reads more like light-hearted poetry. The graceful
									descriptions of space, time, light, dust, foliage, elements, pets and
									people were all masterfully written. I found myself wanting to be in the
									small Oregon coastal town, among its quirky inhabitants.</p>
